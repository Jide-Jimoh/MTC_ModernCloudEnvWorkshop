# Deploying Nasuni Filer on Azure

> **Difficulty**: Intermediate (assumes basic familiarity with Azure and Networking)

> **Time**: Approximately 75+ minutes

Nasuni delivers an advanced storage solution using a cloud infrastructure. The core technology is a
next-generation storage controller – the Nasuni Filer – that offers the security and performance of
traditional storage, while adding unlimited scalability, automatic offsite protection, and global multi-site
access to files. The Nasuni system is managed through a single, small-footprint point of control within
the enterprise’s data center.
The Nasuni Filer is an on-premises storage device supporting NFS, CIFS, FTP/SFTP, iSCSI, and HTTP/
REST protocols. The Nasuni Filer is fully integrated with Active Directory, LDAP, Distributed File System
(DFS), and Windows Previous Versions. It includes a high-performance cache and takes periodic
snapshots that enable file-level restores. Its reach and capacity far exceed those of a traditional
controller, however, because it does not rely only on memory and local disk to manage its data: it has
the entire capacity of the cloud at its disposal. All data is deduplicated, compressed, and encrypted
before storage.

This lab outlines the steps necessary to get your Nasuni Filer up and running on the Azure platform.
