# Rubrik API 101

One exciting change slowly percolating throughout the data center is the use of RESTful (Representational State Transfer) APIs to control operations. Rather than having to learn a large swath of DSL (domain specific languages) for each endpoint, the use of a RESTful architecture means any valid language that can make API calls is available to you and your team. This results in a simpler model for data center architecture and an increase in opportunities for automation and orchestration.
						
The Rubrik REST API provides a RESTful interface for working with Rubrik clusters and Rubrik Edge virtual appliances. The Rubrik REST API can be used to query, configure, and control nearly all of the operations of the Rubrik software.

Transform APIs into a strategic asset instead of a technical tool. Rubrik’s native RESTful APIs allow users to automate the delivery of data management services (apply SLA policies, automate recovery testing plans, etc.) with granular control. Unlike legacy solutions, Rubrik has integrated an API-first architecture from Day 1 and consumes the same APIs published to users (“we drink our own champagne”). Users can quickly start automating services with Rubrik’s APIs - at a high level, this means associating an object with a desired end state (“what to use” + “what rules to follow”). 

API Documentation and Playground	

To view Rubrik’s native API documentation:

1. Open a new tab in your web browser and navigate to assigned API documentation URL. 

2. Browse through the documentation to learn more about Rubrik APIs and how they may be used. 

3. Scroll down to **SLA Domains > Retrieving SLA Domains**. Read through this section. The documentation provides code snippets and parameters to make it easy for you to learn and use our APIs. Everything is documented using ReDoc, if you go to a specific URL endpoint, Rubrik will provide out the documentation for the APIs.

4. Open a new tab in your web browser and navigate to assigned API playground URL.

5. In the top right-hand corner, click Authorize.

6. Ensure your assigned domain username and password. Click **Authorize**.

7. Navigate to **/sla_domain** and click **Show/Hide**. Click **Get list of SLA Domains**.

8. Under **Parameters**, enter a **Value** for name. 

9. Click **Try it out!**

# Example Use Cases

The uses cases with Rubrik’s RESTful APIs are unlimited. This section is intended to provide a few examples of what you could do. 
					
**Configuration Management** - Easily plug into config management tools (i.e. Puppet, Chef, Salt, Ansible) to simplify deployments across hundreds of servers or VMs. Tag objects with metadata via the API. Rubrik auto-assigns associated data protection policies when new objects are created.
						
**Orchestration Management** - Leverage service catalogues to deliver Rubrik-as-a-Service with custom pre-built integrations. Simplify orchestration of daily data management tasks (backup, recovery, and archival) with self-service and get customized analytics built-into your tool of choice.
						
* **ServiceNow** - Deploy the Rubrik app from the ServiceNow Store to deliver critical data management functions (automated data protection, self-service le recovery, test/dev, analytics) through items presented in ServiceNow’s Service Catalog.

* **VMware vRealize Orchestrator & Automation** - Perform self-service data management tasks through vRO/vRA. Modify SLA protection policies, create backups on-demand, and instantly recover VMs within the vRealize portal.
						
**Application and Server Validation** - Instantly provision copies to test restore of data, applications, and entire servers against an orchestration engine with minimal API calls (i.e. build a live mount in one line of code).
						
**Automated Recovery Testing** - Conduct end-to-end recovery testing in less than three minutes with a simple script. Create a live mount, run tests to validate, and shut down in only a few lines of code. Use any language of your choice or Rubrik’s pre-built PowerShell module to get started quickly.
